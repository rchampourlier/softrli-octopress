    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Let's assume:</h3>

<ul>
<li>you're using RSpec for your tests,</li>
<li>you use Capybara for your integration/acceptance specs,</li>
<li>you run your tests in a Vagrant box.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let's also say everything is working fine (I won't deal with any issue you may have before this point).</p>

<p>Now, <strong>you have some features / user stories / whatever that requires some Javascript action</strong>.</p>

<h3>Well.</h3>

<p><strong>If you weren't using Vagrant</strong>, I'd say everything should go fine too. Just append <code>:js =&gt; true</code> to your RSpec example, it will use Selenium and everything will go fine using your installed Firefox binary.</p>

<p>But <strong>you're testing in a Vagrant box</strong>. So here's what you'll get:</p>

<p>```
Failure/Error: visit "/whatever"</p>

<pre><code> Selenium::WebDriver::Error::WebDriverError:
   Could not find Firefox binary (os=linux). Make sure Firefox is installed or set the path manually with Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Binary.path=
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>So you may say, fine, let's install Firefox!</h3>

<p>But... your Vagrant box is meant to be <strong>used in headless mode</strong>, and Firefox requires something to draw on. Still, you may have it to work. But I'll assume (again) that <strong>you don't want to bother with setting things for the client-side of the test on the development/test box</strong> (which is more server-side) <strong>, and use everything that's already on you real development machine</strong> (your day-to-day browsers).</p>

<p><em>If my assumption is false, you can have a look to <a href="http://www.without-brains.net/blog/2012/08/01/capybara-and-selenium-with-vagrant/">this article</a>, which explains both approaches (but not for RSpec, that's the why of this article).</em></p>

<h3>The solution? selenium server!</h3>

<p>What you want is Capybara to use its selenium driver, but <strong>instead of running a local copy of the browser</strong>, use <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">selenium server</a> which will <strong>allows Capybara to use browsers running in your real development machine</strong> (the host of your Vagrant development box).</p>

<h3>Ok I got it, how do I do it?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.without-brains.net/blog/2012/08/01/capybara-and-selenium-with-vagrant/">This article</a> is pretty well made, with far more explanations that I provide, so I encourage you to have a look to fully understand how it works. However, <strong>it doesn't provide the solution if you're using RSpec</strong>, since it builds a simple <code>Unit::TestCase</code> example.</p>

<p><strong>This is where I truly do something.</strong></p>

<h3>Here's how to get it working with RSpec (and even in Spork)</h3>

<p>Add this one line in your <code>spec_helper.rb</code> file (one line?!!!):</p>

<p><code>
  require_relative 'support/capybara_remote'
</code></p>

<p>After the <code>require 'capybara/rspec'</code> would be great. If you're using Spork, it should be in the <code>prefork</code> block.</p>

<p>Well, not truly a one-liner. Add this to a <code>spec/support/capybara_remote.rb</code> file too:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4038197.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code># SELENIUM_SERVER is the IP address or hostname of the system running Selenium
# Server, this is used to determine where to connect to when using one of the
# selenium_remote_* drivers
SELENIUM_SERVER = &quot;10.10.11.1&quot;

# SELENIUM_APP_HOST is the IP address or hostname of this system (where the
# tests run against) as reachable for the SELENIUM_SERVER. This is used to set
# the Capybara.app_host when using one of the selenium_remote_* drivers
SELENIUM_APP_HOST = &quot;10.10.11.2&quot;

# CAPYBARA_DRIVER is the Capybara driver to use, this defaults to Selenium with
# Firefox
CAPYBARA_DRIVER = &quot;selenium_remote_firefox&quot;

# At this point, Capybara.default_driver is :rack_test, and
# Capybara.javascript_driver is :selenium. We can't run :selenium in the Vagrant box,
# so we set the javascript driver to :selenium_remote_firefox which we're going to
# configure.
Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium_remote_firefox

RSpec.configure do |config|

  config.before(:each) do
    if selenium_remote?
      Capybara.app_host = &quot;http://#{SELENIUM_APP_HOST}:#{page.driver.rack_server.port}&quot;
    end
  end

  config.after(:each) do
    Capybara.reset_sessions!
    Capybara.use_default_driver
    Capybara.app_host = nil
  end

  # Determines if a selenium_remote_* driver is being used
  def selenium_remote?
    !(Capybara.current_driver.to_s =~ /\Aselenium_remote/).nil?
  end
end

# Set the default driver to CAPYBARA_DRIVER, when you change the driver in one
# of your tests resetting it to the default will ensure that its reset to what
# you specified when starting the tests.
#Capybara.default_driver = CAPYBARA_DRIVER.to_sym

# CapybaraDriverRegistrar is a helper class that enables you to easily register
# Capybara drivers
class CapybaraDriverRegistrar

  # register a Selenium driver for the given browser to run on the localhost
  def self.register_selenium_local_driver(browser)
    Capybara.register_driver &quot;selenium_#{browser}&quot;.to_sym do |app|
      Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: browser)
    end
  end

  # register a Selenium driver for the given browser to run with a Selenium
  # Server on another host
  def self.register_selenium_remote_driver(browser)
    Capybara.register_driver &quot;selenium_remote_#{browser}&quot;.to_sym do |app|
      Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: :remote, url: &quot;http://#{SELENIUM_SERVER}:4444/wd/hub&quot;, desired_capabilities: browser)
    end
  end
end

# Register various Selenium drivers
CapybaraDriverRegistrar.register_selenium_remote_driver(:firefox)</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Be sure to adjust the constants (<code>SELENIUM_SERVER</code>, <code>SELENIUM_APP_HOST</code>, <code>CAPYBARA_DRIVER</code>) to match your configuration (as explained in the comments).</p>

<p>Now, get the selenium server <code>.jar</code> and run it on your real machine (the host of your Vagrant) with this command:</p>

<p><code>
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar
</code></p>

<p>Now, any RSpec example with the <code>:js =&gt; true</code> metadata should be running in your Firefox browser on your real machine, where you can see it!</p>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>

<p>We've seen how to use <strong>selenium server</strong> to allow <strong>Capybara</strong> running in a <strong>Vagrant box</strong> to use the host's <strong>browsers</strong> to run <strong>RSpec</strong> specs requiring <strong>Javascript</strong>.</p>
